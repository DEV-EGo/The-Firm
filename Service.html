                <p>
                    due to the Oct. 3, 2018, termination of the 1955 Treaty of Amity, Economic Relations, and Consular
                    Rights with Iran, Iranian nationals are no longer eligible for E-1 treaty trader and E-2 treaty
                    investor changes or extensions of status based on the treaty.

                    The E-1 and E-2 nonimmigrant visa classifications allow an alien of a treaty country to be admitted
                    to the United States for the purposes of engaging in international trade or investing a substantial
                    amount of capital into a U.S. business.
                </p>

                <p>
                    E-1 and E-2 nonimmigrant visas are based on trade and investment treaties or specific legislation
                    providing for reciprocal treatment of the respective countries’ nationals. The existence of a
                    qualifying treaty or authorizing legislation is therefore a threshold requirement for issuing an E
                    visa.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Due to the termination of the treaty, USCIS will send Notices of Intent to Deny to affected
                    applicants who filed applications after the Department of State’s Oct. 3, 2018, announcement.
                    Iranians currently holding and properly maintaining E-1 or E-2 status may remain in the U.S. until
                    their current status expires.
                </p>

            <p>
                Father was being denied contact with his 2 young girls. The Mother had given the 11 year old and 7 year
                old the impression that they could decide whether or not to spend time with their Father. Father then
                retained us to restore his contact with both girls and increase his parenting time. Mother’s
                uncooperative behavior throughout the litigation was ongoing. Even after she retained an attorney, she
                continued her ongoing refusal to facilitate and encourage our client’s parenting time, making serious
                allegations against our client to justify her behavior.
            </p>
            <p>

                By the time that we got to the trial, 10 long months had passed and Father had missed-out on substantial
                time with his daughters. During the trial, Mother’s attorney attempted every “trick in the book,” to try
                and convince the Court that Mother’s obstruction was justified, due to her allegations against Father.
                However, after a 3 hour trial where both sides of the case were presented to the Court, the Judge issued
                a detailed Ruling on the record that supported all of our arguments during the trial. Further, the Court
                specifically found that Mother’s allegations of drug use, significant domestic violence and mental
                illness, were unsubstantiated.

            </p>

            <p>

                Our client won in a landslide: he was granted sole legal custody of both children. In addition, he was
                granted the parenting time that he was requesting. The Court also warned and assured Mother that, if the
                parties appeared before the Court again and Father had not seen the children, that Mother would leave
                the Courtroom in handcuffs. Finally, the client was granted an award of attorneys fees and costs.
